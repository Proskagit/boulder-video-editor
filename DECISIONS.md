# Architectural Decisions

This file records decisions that should remain stable unless there is a deliberate reason to change them.

## D001 — MediaTime precision

MediaTime uses 100-nanosecond ticks.

Reason:
- precise timeline representation
- compatibility with .NET time representations
- avoids unnecessary floating-point precision loss

Status: Accepted.

---

## D002 — FFmpeg / FFprobe

FFmpeg and FFprobe are part of the media pipeline.

Status: Accepted.

---

## D003 — .NET / Avalonia

The application is a desktop application built with .NET 8 and Avalonia.

Status: Accepted.

---

## D004 — MVVM

CommunityToolkit.Mvvm is used for MVVM functionality.

Status: Accepted.

---

## D005 — Logging

Serilog is used for application logging.

Status: Accepted.

## D006 — Rational frame rate and exact frame grid

Date: 2026-09-23

Decision: `MediaTime` stays in 100 ns ticks (D001 unchanged). Frame rates are an
exact rational `FrameRate` (numerator/denominator, e.g. 30000/1001). Frame n starts
at `round_half_up(n · 10⁷ · den / num)` ticks, computed in integer arithmetic
(`Int128`); `MediaTime.FromFrame` / `ToFrameFloor` / `ToNearestFrame` /
`SnapToFrame` round-trip exactly. The former `double`-based frame conversions were
removed. Every clip edge on the timeline is exactly on the project frame grid;
edits compute both edges from frame indices.

Context: most rates (24, 30, 29.97, …) don't divide 10⁷ ticks, so a frame boundary
is not an integer tick; double-based conversion wasn't guaranteed to round-trip.
Flicks (a different time unit) were considered and rejected to keep D001.

Consequences: the tick length of the same frame count can differ by one tick
between positions. Source limits use `FrameMath.MaxWholeFrames` so a clip never
extends past its source at any position.

Status: Accepted.

## D007 — Project frame rate from the first video

Date: 2026-09-23

Decision: a new project uses a provisional 30 FPS. Adding the first video clip to
the timeline fixes `ProjectSettings.FrameRate` from the file's `r_frame_rate` and sets
`IsFrameRateLocked`; existing clips are moved to the new grid in the same undoable
step (each edge to its nearest frame; a clip that would collapse grows by one frame
into free space; otherwise the add is rejected atomically). Unknown or out-of-range
source rates (outside 1–240 FPS) lock a 30 FPS fallback and say so explicitly.
After locking, the rate never changes automatically; deleting videos doesn't unlock
— only undoing the locking add does.

Status: Accepted.

## D008 — Timeline editing rules (Phase 4)

Date: 2026-09-23

Decision:
- A video file is one `VideoClip` that carries its own audio; no linked V/A pairs yet.
- Overlapping clips on a track are rejected (no overwrite/ripple). Trims clamp to
  neighbours, the source media and a one-frame minimum.
- Video/audio can be added only after successful analysis (duration known); images
  immediately, 5 s by default.
- Only `Speed = 1.0` is editable; edits of clips with any other speed are rejected.
- All edits go through `ITimelineEditService`, which validates the complete result
  before executing one `IUndoableCommand` (absolute before/after snapshots).
  Selection, playhead, zoom and the snapping toggle are view state, not undoable.
- Any timeline change marks the project dirty; a save point (clean after undo) is Phase 6.

Status: Accepted.

## How to add a decision

When a major architectural decision is made, add:

- ID
- Date
- Decision
- Context
- Consequences
- Status

Do not rewrite old decisions merely because a newer approach is preferred. Supersede them explicitly.
