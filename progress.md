# Project Progress

## Current phase

Phase 4 — Timeline: implemented, accepted by the product owner and committed
on branch `feat/phase-3-media-analysis` ("feat: implement Phase 4 timeline editing").

## Last known state

Phases 0–3 are complete and committed (see `ROADMAP.md`). Work continues on
branch `feat/phase-3-media-analysis` (per product owner decision).

Phase 4 implemented (decisions: DECISIONS.md D006–D008):
- Exact time model: rational `FrameRate`, integer frame grid in `MediaTime`
  (double-based frame conversions removed; D001 unchanged).
- Project frame rate: provisional 30 FPS, fixed by the first video (from
  `r_frame_rate`, fallback 30 FPS stated explicitly), existing clips re-gridded in the
  same undo step, atomic rejection if impossible.
- `ITimelineEditService` / `TimelineEditService`: add (button → end of V1/A1,
  drag-and-drop → track + position), move (incl. between tracks), trim (clamped),
  split (selection or everything under the playhead), delete, add track, snapping.
  All undoable; validation before execution.
- Default tracks V1/A1; `TimelineChanged` + IsDirty on any timeline change.
- Timeline panel: real tracks/clips, ruler (visible range only), playhead
  (ruler click/drag, frame steps), zoom (Ctrl+wheel at pointer, buttons/hotkeys at
  playhead, fit), selection (click, Ctrl+click), drag move with red invalid preview,
  trim handles, snap indicator.
- Inspector shows the selected clip (non-drop-frame timecode); Transform hidden until Phase 7.
- Preview shows the real playhead and sequence duration; Play reports "Phase 5".
- Hotkeys: Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z, Delete/Backspace, S, N, ←/→,
  Shift+←/→, Home/End, Ctrl+= / Ctrl+−; ignored while a TextBox has focus.

## Completed

- Phase 0
- Phase 1
- Phase 2
- Phase 3

## Known issues

- Hotkey guard for text input is implemented but could not be exercised in the
  running app: Phase 4 UI has no visible text field (Inspector Transform is hidden).
- `ffmpeg-*.log` is never written: nothing tags log events with `Area=Ffmpeg`.
- Media analysis has no concurrency limit and no cancellation on New Project.
- `MediaAnalysisCoordinator` relies on the captured UI SynchronizationContext.
- Timecode is non-drop-frame only (29.97 timecode drifts from wall clock by design).
- Timeline canvas is a plain ItemsControl/Canvas; very long timelines at maximum
  zoom are not virtualized (ruler is).
- Media import is not undoable (unchanged from Phase 2).

## Verification

2026-09-23:
- `dotnet build`: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- `dotnet test`: 160 passed (Core.Tests 62, Timeline.Tests 80, UI.Tests 18).
- Manual run (Windows, generated test media incl. 29.97 FPS video): import, add image/
  audio/video, FPS lock to 29.97 with status message and re-grid, Inspector timecode,
  drag move, trim, ruler playhead, split via S, undo ×3, drag-and-drop from the Media
  Browser, add track + Ctrl+Z, S/N hotkeys.
